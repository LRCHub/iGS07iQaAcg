[00:00.36] I've been tryna keep my distance
[00:03.32] But in an instant you break me down
[00:08.25] I know better than to want you
[00:11.05] But I succumb to you without a doubt
[00:29.05] 
[00:15.08] Now the water is rising
[00:16.87] And I'm too tired to swim
[00:19.07] And my lungs just can't take it
[00:20.77] But I keep breathing you in, so
[00:36.27] 
[00:23.56] Tell me lies, tell me painted truths
[00:27.12] Anything at all to keep me close to you
[00:31.21] Pull me under the way you do
[00:34.55] Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[00:54.55] 
[00:38.85] Oh-oh-oh
[00:42.28] Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[00:46.85] Oh-oh-oh
[00:50.09] Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[01:10.09] 
[01:05.52] Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[01:25.52] 
[01:32.38] And now the water is rising
[01:34.23] And I'm too tired to swim
[01:36.58] And my lungs just can't take it
[01:38.25] But I keep breathing you in, so
[01:53.75] 
[01:42.83] Tell me lies, tell me painted truths
[01:46.37] Anything at all to keep me close to you
[01:50.57] Pull me under the way you do
[01:53.85] Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[01:58.36] Oh
[01:59.36] 
[02:09.26] Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[02:29.26] 
[02:24.75] Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
